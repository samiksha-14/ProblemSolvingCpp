//basically we have to find a peak element whose all the elements to the right are
//all in sorted order ....that element will tell that till that place all permutation
//have been exhaused and it was the last choice
//like in 123-->132...now all possible patterns of 2 and 3 are finished because 3 is the
//largest ...so after finding that peak element we will backtrack from that element
//that means that element prior to that element will take part in permutation now
//so we have to find a element to swap that element and that element needs to be the
//just greater element than that because if it is smaller then we will not be getting
//greater permutation and after fixing that just greater element to that position
//we can sort the rest of the list bec we want smallest lexicographic order
